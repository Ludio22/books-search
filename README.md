## How I worked on this project

The project was made according to the technical requirements for the test task (I do not disclose details)

* I used the react / redux bundle and several additional libraries to build the application.
* Component animation was done using [react-reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/) library.
* Createasyncthunk from redux / toolkit was used for asynchronous operations

## How to navigate this project

* Main logic and data of the project [Example](https://github.com/Ludio22/books-search/blob/main/src/store/mainSlice.js)
* All SCSS styles are [here](https://github.com/Ludio22/books-search/blob/main/src/styles/styles.scss)
* All data taken from google books api is in the slice from the first link

## Why i build project this way

* Using redux for storing state seems to me a very convenient solution, which allows you to focus on each part of the program separately, so I will not dwell on this.
* I have not used style libraries like bootstrap (apart from react-reveal) because I prefer to write all the styles myself, I like to have full control over the components.

## If I have more time I would change this

* It would be nice to polish the styles. The layout does not break but is not as good as we would like.
* I would put additional functions for interacting with elements in a separate file, but this will take more time.
 
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
